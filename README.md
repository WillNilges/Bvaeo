# Bvaeo
This is Bvaeo, where you battle variables against each other. It's a weird little statistics-based combat system I made when I was 15 and just trying to learn C#. I found it on an almost-dead hard drive and wanted to preserve it a little better because I figured I might want to poke around it a little more at some point. Enjoy?
